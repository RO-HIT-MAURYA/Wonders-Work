# Rotate Marker and Move Animation on Map like Uber,Ola,Lyft,careem in Android

I am working on a project similar to UBER, Lyft or OLA ie. Map on the home with available moving Cars. I was looking for some kind of Library which can make Cars move and take turn smoothly just like UBER,OLA,careem. For now I am able to move car smoothly from one lat-long to another with the mentioned code. But tricky part is Taking turn and make sure the car face to front when moving to direction.

Enjoy the work and ease your working hours :)
